## Fitness Program DSL

The Fitness Program DSL project is a dynamic and interactive platform that seamlessly combines the world of fitness and programming. It offers users a visually intuitive means to create personalized workout routines while delving into core concepts of parsing, interpretation, and compilation. At its core, this DSL empowers users to design fitness routines by dragging and dropping visual blocks representing exercises, repetitions, sets, and rest, making fitness accessible to individuals of all experience levels. This visual representation necessitates robust parsing capabilities, as the DSL must intelligently convert these visual routines into structured workout plans.

### Motivation
The motivation behind the Fitness Program DSL project is to help users build their fitness regimens. The DSL acts as an interpreter, translating the visual routines into actionable exercises. Here, interpretation and compilation principles come into play, ensuring the user's input is transformed into executable workout programs. Furthermore, the project emphasizes verification by safeguarding users against unsafe practices. It scrutinizes workout routines to ensure they adhere to established exercise principles, verifying the correctness and effectiveness of each plan.

### How our project relates to the topics of parsing, interpretation and compilation
Our Fitness Program DSL project is intimately connected to the fields of parsing, interpretation, and compilation. Parsing plays a pivotal role as it allows our platform to intelligently convert the visually created workout routines—comprising blocks representing exercises, repetitions, and sets—into structured workout plans. The accuracy of this parsing process is paramount in ensuring that users receive the workout routines they intend to create. Subsequently, interpretation and compilation principles come into play as our DSL acts as an interpreter, translating these visual routines into actionable, executable workout programs. This transformation process involves understanding the semantics of each exercise, repetition scheme, and set arrangement to compile them into a coherent and effective workout routine. By adhering to these principles, our project bridges the gap between fitness and programming, offering users a dynamic and interactive platform to create, understand, and execute personalized fitness routines with ease and precision.
