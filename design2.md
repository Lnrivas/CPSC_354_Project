## - Continuing from last week, explain how the code generated by Blockly will be executed. Specify the output of each Blockly code in pseudo-code.
* Exercise Block

* Set Block

* Repetition Block

* Rest Block


## - Show a use case for a recursive Blockly program, illustrating that Blockly allows the user to build infinitley many complex programs from a small number of building blocks.


## - Describe the data that your project needs to maintain and explain how the blockbased programming language interacts with this data. Design the outlines of a database (if appropriate).


## - If your project involves external divices (cars, robots, IoT, etc), you will want to test your code on a simulator. Describe the simulator software you are planning to use.
