# Peer Review Process

## Pull Requests
Reviewing the pull request was good because it gave us an idea for a new feature, the Weight block. However, it had very little usable code and required our team to add lots of code to it before merging it. Finally this ended with us having a new, complete, functional, and tested weight block that is now fully integrated into our project. It was good experience learning how to use pull requests and review them and merge them.
