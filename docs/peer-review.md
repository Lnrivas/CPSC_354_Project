# Peer Review Process

## Pull Requests
Reviewing the pull request was good because it gave us an idea for a new feature, the Weight block. However, it had very little usable code and required our team to add lots of code to it before merging it. Finally this ended with us having a new, complete, functional, and tested weight block that is now fully integrated into our project. It was good experience learning how to use pull requests and review them and merge them. 

## Issues
The issues that were given to us were generally about adding variables (like a weight variable and respective blocks), a warmup block type section, adding a dropdown menu of prebuilt exercises, and adding features of a log book. It would be interesting to add to the logbook but we would need to only issue a set of code that adds to a prebuilt template.
